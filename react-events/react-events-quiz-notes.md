- What is an "event handler"? Which component declares the handler?
  An "event handler" in React is a function that determines the response when a specific event occurs, and it is usually declared within the component that needs to handle the event.
- How do you pass an event handler to a React component?
  Include the handler function as a prop when rendering the component, allowing it to be accessed and used within the component for responding to specific events.
- What is the naming convention for event handlers?
  The naming convention for event handlers in React typically follows the pattern of "handle" followed by the type of event and then a brief description of what the handler does.
- What is an "event handler prop"? Which component declares the prop?
  An "event handler prop" in React is a prop passed from a parent component to a child component, containing a function that the child component can use as an event handler to respond to specific events. The parent component declares and defines this prop, which the child component then uses to implement the event handling behavior.

  onButtonClick,onSubmitForm
- What is the naming convention for custom event handler props?
  The naming convention for custom event handler props in React typically follows the pattern of "on" followed by the type of event or action, and then a brief description of what the handler does, like "onSubmitForm" or "onToggleModal".
